    \caption{\emph{Average running time for single-instance robustness verification} in seconds per correctly-predicted instance on CIFAR-10 models of different verification approaches. The verification is on $\cL_\infty$ ball with $\epsilon$~(specified in table) radius. We stop the execution when time exceeds $\SI{60}{s}$ per instance. We include running time PGD attack and normal inference as the reference.}
